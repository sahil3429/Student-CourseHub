***Workflow Description***

This website represents a part of university websites where students can look for any specific programme and fill up a form to show their interests. There are some control panel for the staffs and the admin. Also the staffs can get ideas by looking at it to get a overview about their role in certain programmes and modules. This is not a perfect website as we inteded to make. There are plenty of errors as well which can be find out and solve time to time. Also we put some options to further development of the website through writting some programmes which is not yet added with the main files as we are getting a lot of errors on it. But there is a option to include those files later on.
